title: "Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics of Chemical Reaction Networks"
draft: false
---

The nonequilibrium thermodynamic theory for chemical reaction networks is uncompleted. 
Formulations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics in presence of electrochemical or bimolecular photochemical reactions are lacking.
I plan to complete the theory, thus opening the possibility to study the thermodynamics of virtually any chemical system operating arbitrarily far from equilibrium, especially biological ones.
