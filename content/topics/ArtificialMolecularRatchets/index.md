title: "Design Principles of Molecular Ratchets"
draft: false
---

Can we apply the design principles of molecular motors to understand and realize molecular systems and soft materials with broader functionalities?

Systems chemistry is now moving towards using molecular ratchets to perform endergonic synthesis, active transport, and other energy-demanding processes.
My goal is providing a unifying theoretical description of these seemingly disparate nonequilibrium chemical phenomena.
