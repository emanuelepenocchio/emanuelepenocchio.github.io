The gloomy bird over here is Arnath, the irreversibility Demon.
Contrary to the more popular Maxwell's Demon, Arnath loves increasing entropy and locking doors.
Sometimes it makes you lose a train or it helps you move on; you can only come with it.
Arnath's portrait is a gift from the cartoonist _Zerocalcare_.
