Ciao!
I'm Emanuele Penocchio, a physical chemist particularly interested in nonequilibrim systems.
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Gingrich Group](https://gingrich.chem.northwestern.edu/) at the Department of Chemistry of Northwestern University working in theoretical and computational statistical mechanics.
As an undergraduate student in Chemistry, I got so fascinated by molecular motors that I decided to take a PhD in Physics to understand how they work.

Below is a little bit more about my academic career so far. Thanks for visiting my webpage!
