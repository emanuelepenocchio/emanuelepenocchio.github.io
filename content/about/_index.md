Ciao!
I'm Emanuele Penocchio, a physical chemist particularly interested in nonequilibrium systems.
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the [Gingrich Group](https://gingrich.chem.northwestern.edu/) at the Department of Chemistry of Northwestern University working in theoretical and computational statistical mechanics.
As an undergraduate student in Chemistry, I got so fascinated by molecular motors that I decided to take a PhD in Physics to understand how they work.

Below is a little bit more about my academic career so far. Thanks for visiting my webpage!

</span>

`2014 - 2016`
__Full-ride scholarship__, _Scuola Normale Superiore_

<span style="font-size:10pt;">
The [<em>Scuola Normale Superiore</em>](https://www.sns.it/en/la-normale-si-presenta) (SNS) is a public higher education institution in Pisa, analogue to the <em>École normale supérieure</em> in France.
Students are admitted by a national selection with top 5\% acceptance rate and have to complete extra advanced coursework on top of the standard program at the University of Pisa.
Joining the SNS community was a breakthrough in my education and I am willing to share my experience and advice to Italian and International students interested to learn more.
</span>

`2011-2014`
__Full-ride scholarship__, University of Bologna

<span style="font-size:10pt;">
The [<em>Collegio Superiore</em>](https://site.unibo.it/collegio-superiore/en) is the honors program of the University of Bologna.
Admission is grounded on a national selection and students have to complete extra advanced coursework on top of the standard university classes.
At the University of Bologna only about one student out of a thousand across all disciplines belongs to this program.
It was an invaluable opportunity to enrich my Bachelor's study and meet long-standing friends; I am happy to share my experience and advice to Italian and International students interested in this program.
