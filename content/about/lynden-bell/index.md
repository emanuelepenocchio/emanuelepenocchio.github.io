Humbled to receive the 2024 SMTG Ruth Lynden-Bell PhD prize!
I am grateful to the Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics Group of the Royal Society of Chemistry for this biannual honor.
Thanks to the University if Luxembourg and all my collaborators for making it possible.

`Motivation`
"During his PhD Emanuele worked on the theory of the thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks.
Notably he applied these ideas to molecular motors, using the theory to improve their thermodynamic efficiency."
