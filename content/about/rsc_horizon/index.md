My role in the team was pretending to write the SI in latex... but here's something to be super happy about:
Together with my fantastic collaborators, we won the 2023 Royal Society of Chemistry Horizon Prize for Physical Organic Chemistry "for breakthroughs in catalysed non-equilibrium systems, particularly molecular ratchet mechanisms, that have provided fundamental insights into the dynamics of matter."!

Congratulations to all Molecular Ratcheteers!
