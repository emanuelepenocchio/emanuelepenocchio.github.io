Delighted by receiving the 2022 Foresight Institute Student Award.
Thanks to the Foresight Institute for the honor and to [Dr. Giulio Ragazzon](https://ragazzonlab.isis.unistra.fr/) for the nomination.

I am grateful to everybody who supported my PhD at the University of Luxembourg through mentoring, collaborations, and many, many discussions!

`Motivation:`
"Emanuele Penocchio pioneered a new generation of physical chemists able to connect supramolecular chemistry to the out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic concepts being developed by theoretical physicists.
He extended information thermodynamics of chemical reaction networks to molecular machines driven by catalysis or light, leading to design principles for molecular manufacturing.
In addition, Emanuele used theoretical advancements to quantitatively analyze experimental systems in collaboration with two leading groups in molecular nanotechnology, namely the Leigh group and the Credi group, establishing the efficiency of synthetic molecular motors.‚Äù
