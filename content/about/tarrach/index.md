I am very humble to receive the 2023 Tarrach Award!

Each year, the non-profit association <em>Les Amis de l’Université du Luxembourg</em> (Friends of the University of Luxembourg) acknowledges an individual for the best PhD thesis of the University of Luxembourg.

A huge "thank you" to everyone who made it possible: prizes are often individual, but science is always a collective enterprise.
